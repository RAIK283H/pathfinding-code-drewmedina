# Pathfinding Starter Code

The code should show statistics for each player on the scoreboard.
I added a visited nodes to see how many different stops each player would do.

My requirements for the random path is that on the path to the target and the path from the target to destination there is no repeating nodes. I did a depth first search and randomly added a neighbor to the stack to get the final path.

I did the extra credit for using heapq and adding F_W into the pathing class
